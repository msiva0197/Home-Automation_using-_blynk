🔌 ESP32 Blynk Controlled LED 
📌 Project Overview

This IoT project uses an ESP32, Relay Module, and Blynk App to remotely control LEDs.
The relay modules act as switches that turn ON/OFF the LEDs based on commands sent from the Blynk mobile app.

✅ Works on WiFi using ESP32
✅ Controlled via Blynk IoT App
✅ Can extend to control appliances (Bulb, Fan, etc.)
